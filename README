The MIT Tour-ing Machine provides those that frequent MIT (students, tourists, etc.) an interactive and informative tool to learn about MIT’s rich history, such as hacks. We designed and developed an iOS application focusing on a tour of the Stata Center. The application provides a “museum tour” highlighting some major events that have taken place at MIT. Using a combination of different sensor technologies (BLE beacons and built-in phone sensors), we determine the exhibit the user is closest to and provide the user with relevant information.
